## Shared Name and Email, Password
We have 2 cases:
- Someone is already a POSMO One user and has therefore an account, now s/he wants to upgrade and become a cooperative member.
- Someone wants to become a cooperative member.

Name, email, password, are shared with Datamap, so that people have the same login.         
If someone already has a Posmo app login, s/he can use the same and only has to fill out the rest.
